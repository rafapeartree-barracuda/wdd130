            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Rafael Roberto" width="200">
            <p>Hello, my name is Rafael Roberto, and I am from São Paulo, Brazil. I have been a member of the church since 1994, which
            has been a significant and enriching part of my life. My faith and community involvement have shaped who I am today,
            providing me with a strong foundation of values and a deep sense of purpose.</p>
            
            <p>In 2001, I embarked on a profound journey of service as a missionary in Brasília, Brazil. During my time as a
            missionary, I had the opportunity to connect with people from various backgrounds, cultures, and walks of life. This
            experience was incredibly rewarding, as it allowed me to make a positive impact on the lives of many individuals,
            offering support, guidance, and a sense of hope. It also taught me the importance of empathy, communication, and
            resilience, qualities that have been invaluable throughout my personal and professional life.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I am working at Salesforce as a Solutions Architect. In this role, I am responsible for designing and
            implementing innovative solutions that address complex business challenges. My work involves collaborating with clients
            to understand their needs and objectives, and then leveraging Salesforce's powerful platform to create tailored
            solutions that drive efficiency, productivity, and growth. This position allows me to utilize my technical expertise and
            problem-solving skills while continuously learning and adapting to new technologies and industry trends.</p>
            
            <p>Being a Solutions Architect at Salesforce is not just about the technical aspects; it's also about building strong
            relationships with clients and stakeholders, understanding their unique challenges, and providing them with the best
            possible solutions. I take great pride in my work and strive to deliver excellence in every project I undertake.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to my professional endeavors, I am passionate about personal development and lifelong learning. I believe
            that staying curious and open to new experiences is essential for growth and success. Whether it's through reading,
            attending workshops, or engaging in community activities, I am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and
            skills.</p>
            
            <p>In summary, my journey from São Paulo to Brasília and now as a Solutions Architect at Salesforce has been filled with
            meaningful experiences and valuable lessons. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had and look forward to
            continuing to make a positive impact in both my personal and professional life.</p>

            <h2>São Paulo, Brazil</h2>
            <img src="images/saopaulo.jpeg" alt="São Paulo landscape">
            <p>São Paulo (Portuguese for 'Saint Paul') is the most populous city in Brazil
            and serves as the capital of the state of São Paulo. Recognized by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo holds the
            title of the most populous city in the world outside of Asia and ranks as the 20th-largest city proper globally by
            population. It is also the largest Portuguese-speaking city worldwide. The city exerts significant international
            influence in commerce, finance, arts, and entertainment. Named in honor of the Apostle Saint Paul of Tarsus, São Paulo's
            metropolitan area, known as Greater São Paulo, is the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous globally. The
            conurbation process between the metropolitan areas surrounding Greater São Paulo, including Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí,
            Sorocaba, and São José dos Campos, has led to the formation of the São Paulo Macrometropolis. This megalopolis boasts
            over 30 million inhabitants, making it one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.</p>
